This is my neovim configuration, This is heavily (and I mean heavily) based on chris@machine's (or lunarvim's I am not sure) [basic ide setup](https://github.com/LunarVim/nvim-basic-ide) I just added a few plugins and changed some things to my liking (also fixed an issue), I would recommend you don't use this and instead use the original if you plan on tweaking it, Maybe this will eventually be completely different, but that time isn't now. 

If you want to use this please follow the instructions [here](https://github.com/LunarVim/nvim-basic-ide/#get-healthy)
